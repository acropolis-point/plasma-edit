# Plasma JS

Plasma JS is a pure Javascript GUI toolkit, like Tkinter. All you need to do is create a folder with the dependencies. 

# Dependencies

Plasma JS is designed to be lightweight, and accessible to everybody. The only external dependencies are a web browser with JavaScript enabled, and a text editor such as Sublime Text or Atom.

You can create a Plasma.JS project by creating a folder on your device, with three files: index.html and main.js. In index.html, enter the following code:
``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <style></style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/acropolis-point/plasma.js/master/plasma.js"></script>
    <script src = "main.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```
Main.js is your plasmaJS client. You will enter commands there.
